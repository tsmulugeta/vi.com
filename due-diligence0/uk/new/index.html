		    	<h1><span class="green-text">ABOUT</span> ViSALUS</h1>
		    	<p>ViSalus<sup>&trade;</sup> is a lifestyle transformation company that champions personal achievement through
the <strong>Body by Vi<sup>&trade;</sup> Challenge</strong>, a 90-day health and fitness platform. ViSalus is committed to inspiring personal transformation and entrepreneurship through a social marketing model,
global community culture and premium nutritional products.</p>

<p>ViSalus was founded in 2005 by <strong>Ryan Blair</strong>, <strong>Blake Mallen</strong> and <strong>Nick Sarnicola</strong>&mdash;three
individuals passionate about helping people achieve the best in life, health and prosperity.
Despite their varied backgrounds, all three men were driven, successful entrepreneurs by
the time their paths crossed in 2004. They combined their complementary skill sets and
embarked on a shared mission to inspire and empower people. Their vision for ViSalus was
to transform personal wellness and mentor new entrepreneurs by challenging people to live
up to their own greatness.</p>

<p>The concept of tailoring a personal challenge for mainstream America is what led to
the creation of the Body by Vi Challenge. "Simple, Rewarding and Fun," the <strong>Body by Vi
90&mdash;Day Challenge quickly became the fastest growing weight&mdash;loss and fitness
Challenge in North America</strong>, with more than 150,000 new people joining every month.
Ryan, Blake and Nick have earned a reputation as progressive, social marketing pioneers.
In a mere seven years, ViSalus has <strong>transformed the lives of millions of people with
The Challenge and revolutionized the direct selling industry with a razor-sharp focus
on innovation and technology</strong>. The forward-thinking company was the first to converge
social media and network marketing, driving massive online engagement through the use of
shareable content and cutting-edge digital tools such as <strong>Vi-Net<sup>&reg;</sup> Mobile</strong> and <strong>Vi-Net Swipe</strong>.</p>

<p>Over the last two years, ViSalus has shattered sales records and experienced
explosive growth. ViSalus was awarded the <strong>Direct Selling News' 2012
Bravo Growth Award</strong> for achieving over 600% revenue growth in 2011. In the
first half of 2012, the company's momentum continued with record-breaking
sales of $327 million. ViSalus debuted at #47 on the Direct Sales Industry
<strong>Top 100 Global Companies</strong> and is rapidly climbing toward the top.</p>

				    <h1 class="green-text">THE CHALLENGE</h1>
				    <p>Today, ViSalus is the social marketing company synonymous with two words: <strong>The Challenge</strong>.
The Body by Vi Challenge begins with a simple personal goal set by each individual to improve
their physical health and have fun at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>The Challenge</strong> is built on <strong>five unique Challenge Kits</strong>&mdash;The Fit Kit, Transformation Kit, Core Kit,
Shape Kit and Balance Kit. Products in each Kit are scientifically designed to help burn fat, boost
metabolism and control hunger. Whatever the personal goal, whether to lose weight, gain muscle
or train for a 10k run—there’s a nutritional Challenge Kit to fit every lifestyle.</p>
<p>ViSalus encourages everyone to join the Challenge online and document their results along the way.
At the end of each person’s 90-Day Challenge, they can submit their results for a chance to share in
<strong>$25 million</strong> in free product, prizes and vacations every year.</p>
<p>Winners are selected based on the most inspiring transformation success stories and are crowned
in <strong>six</strong> categories: Male, Female, Couple, Team, Family and a Random Drawing. Winners in each
category are called <strong>Champions</strong> and they are announced and crowned three times per year at
ViSalus National Events. Among other congratulatory gifts, Champions are ultimately rewarded with
the <strong>Hollywood Transformation Vacation</strong>. These trips can include head-to-toe spa makeovers,
stays at the best hotels, professional styling, new attire, photo shoots with celebrity photographers,
sporting events, private jets, live theater productions and more, for a total star treatment!</p>
<p>New in 2013, The Body by Vi Challenge will now include three distinct platforms: <strong>Weight-Loss</strong>,
<strong>Active and Fitness</strong>. This will allow anybody to join The Challenge and select a category to compete
in depending upon whether they want to shed pounds, achieve their optimal physique or accomplish
an athletic activity. Within each platform, there will still be the six categories of Champions and
winners will be chosen based on 50% results, 25% personal story and 25% community vote.</p>
