And so Vi-Cares was born—a broad philanthropic platform that brings Vi Promoters, Customers and employees together to support a range of programs, partners and causes that make a positive impact in the lives of children and families. Reaching out wherever we can, Vi-Cares allows us to share our success with those less fortunate through charitable giving, community service and grassroots initiatives.

			<p class="medium grey-text">When you submit your PROJECT 10 results (either lose 10 lbs or add 10 lbs of lean muscle!) we’ll donate 30 Vi-Shape® Nutritional Shake meals to a child in need, through <strong>PROJECT 10 Kids</strong>. That’s a whole month of nutritious breakfast, lunch or snack options that will put an at-risk, overweight or obese child on the path to a healthier life. When you lose, they win—now through Vitality!</p>
			<p>
			<p><strong class="green-text">HOW IT WORKS</strong></p>
			
<p class="grey-text">1. You lose 10 lbs., or add 10 lbs. of lean muscle, through <a href="http://challenge.com/enter" target="_blank">Project 10.</a> Then submit your results at <a href="http://challenge.com/enter" target="_blank">enter.vi.com</a>.</p>
<p class="grey-text">2. Vi donates 30 Vi-Shape® shake meals to an at-risk or obese child in the United States or Canada. Plus we’ll keep donating every time you lose another 10 lbs. and submit a new “i LOST it.” or “i BUILT it.” video!</p>
<p class="grey-text">3. You receive an “i LOST it.” or “i BUILT it.” t-shirt with “i Sponsored a Child to get Healthy” on the back</p>

<p><strong class="green-text">ALREADY LOST 10 LBS?</strong></p>
<p class="grey-text">We’ll donate for you, too! Vi will give 30 shake meals for every person who has already submitted successful Project 10 results. That’s a whole month’s worth of meals for a child in need thanks to you and PROJECT 10 Kids.   </p>

<p class="no-pad"><strong class="green-text">TWO WAYS TO HELP </strong></p>
<p class="grey-text">At least half the children in America are overweight, obese, malnourished, or victims of nutritional deficiencies that put their lives at risk. Limited options and bad choices are threatening the health of our children and the future of our world. The need for good nutrition has never been greater. And giving it has never been easier. </p>


<p>Vi offers two ways to give the gift of good nutrition to a nutritionally-deficient child in your community.
			</p>
			<p><strong>LOSE</strong> 10 lbs—or add 10 lbs of lean muscle—through Project 10, and Vi will donate 30 shake meals on your behalf to an obesity clinic or food and meal program that helps at-risk children. (If you submit your Project 10 results after May 15, 2013, you can choose your own charity from more than 180 Vi Charity Partners, using the Vi-Net® drop-down Charity Choice menu.)</p>
			<p><strong>DONATE</strong> 30 kid-sized shakes through the Vi-Community Challenge, and Vi will match you shake for shake, doubling your gift to 60 kid-sized shake meals for an at-risk child. Or donate Nutra-Cookies™, and we’ll match you cookie for cookie.</p>
