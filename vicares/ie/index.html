		<p><strong>THE BODY BY VI CHALLENGE® HAS HELPED THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ACHIEVE THEIR PERSONAL HEALTH AND FITNESS GOALS WITH OUR PRODUCTS USED AS PART OF A CALORIE-CONTROLLED DIET AND REGULAR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. </strong></p>
<p>Challenge yourself to lose 10 lbs., or build 10 lbs. of lean muscle through PROJECT 10™. For every 10 lb. lost, you can help a PROJECT 10 ™ Charity.</p>
<p>For every 10 lbs. lost through Project 10 once you have submitted your results we’ll donate 30 Vi Shake Meals or a box of Nutra-Cookies on your behalf to help a PROJECT 10™ Charity receive a healthy meal or snack.  (Vi does not recommend that individuals lose more than 2 Ibs a week.)</p>
<p>Any of our Vi Charity Partners are also able to receive donations through Project 10™. The Charity will be selected internally at random each month. We process donations once a month. We ship in cases of 12 shake pouches or six cookie boxes, with full cases shipping the month following donation. Donations of less than 12 pouches or six cookie boxes are held over to the next month or until a full case has been achieved.</p>

			<p class="white-text top">Another one of the Vi-Cares signature giving programmes is the Vi Community Challenge, a community outreach programme that connects those who want to help with those who need it most. By donating nutritious Vi-Shape® Nutritional Shakes and Nutra-Cookie™ snacks to charities across the UK, Great Britain and Ireland, Vi Promoters and Customers can give back to their local communities by helping hungry or undernourished individuals or families receive the nutrition they need to lead healthier lives.</p>
			<p class="white-text">Join the Vi Community Challenge and support a charity in your community putting individuals on the path to a healthier life. You can make a difference just by donating Vi’s products. Vi will double your donation through  matched giving, helping you provide twice as many Vi Shakes and Cookies to the chosen charity.</p>
			<p class="white-text">Each £19 (<span style=" font-family:Gotham, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">~</span> €28) donation will be automatically matched shake for shake to provide a full pouch of 30 shakes to your chosen charity.</p>
			<p class="white-text">Each £15 (<span style=" font-family:Gotham, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">~</span> €21) donation is automatically matched cookie for cookie to provide a full box of 14 protein-containing Nutra-Cookies.</p>
			<p class="white-text"> There are no limits on how much or how often you can give or how much Vi will match.</p>
